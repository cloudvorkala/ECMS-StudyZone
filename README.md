For my Collaborators:
Follow the instructions to install node.js on your Operating System
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install create react:
npx create-react-app cise-react-learn

Install NEST CLI:
npm i -g @nestjs/cli

To have a .env module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env:
npm i dotenv

You can also run the backend app in development mode by running $ npm run start:dev, so that
the changes to the source files will trigger a restart of the app automatically. (For Frontend)
